# ✅ FastAPI Lifespan Event Handler Update

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - No more deprecation warnings

---

## 🔄 What Changed

Updated `backendServer.py` from deprecated `@app.on_event("startup")` to modern **lifespan event handler**.

---

## ❌ Old Way (Deprecated)

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup_event():
    """Load initial batch of articles on startup"""
    print("Starting backend server...")
    # ... startup code ...

@app.on_event("shutdown")
def shutdown_event():
    """Cleanup on shutdown"""
    print("Shutting down...")
```

**Problem:** 
- `@app.on_event()` is deprecated in FastAPI
- Shows deprecation warning on every startup
- Not async-friendly

---

## ✅ New Way (Modern)

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    """
    Lifespan event handler for FastAPI application.
    Handles startup and shutdown events using modern async context manager.
    """
    # Startup: Load initial batch of articles
    print("Starting backend server...")
    print("Loading articles from our_articles.db...")
    
    loaded = load_articles_batch()
    print(f"Loaded {loaded} articles on startup")
    
    stats = db.get_statistics()
    print(f"Total articles in database: {stats['total_articles']}")
    print(f"Articles with images: {stats['articles_with_images']}")
    
    yield  # Server is running
    
    # Shutdown: Cleanup code goes here (if needed)
    print("Shutting down backend server...")

# Initialize FastAPI app with lifespan handler
app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No deprecation warnings
- ✅ Modern async/await support
- ✅ Cleaner context manager pattern
- ✅ Both startup and shutdown in one place
- ✅ Future-proof (recommended by FastAPI)

## 📝 Changes Made

### File: `backend/backendServer.py`

1. **Added import:**
   ```python
   from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
   ```

2. **Created lifespan function:**
   - Replaced `@app.on_event("startup")` decorator
   - Used `@asynccontextmanager` instead
   - Code before `yield` = startup
   - Code after `yield` = shutdown

3. **Updated FastAPI initialization:**
   ```python
   app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
   ```

4. **Removed:**
   - Old `@app.on_event("startup")` decorator
   - Separate startup/shutdown functions

---

## ✅ Testing Results

```bash
$ python3 backendServer.py
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
Starting backend server...
Loading articles from our_articles.db...
Loaded 12 articles on startup
Total articles in database: 12
Articles with images: 12
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

**Result:** ✅ No deprecation warnings!

## 🔍 How It Works

### Lifespan Context Manager Flow:

```
1. FastAPI starts
   ↓
2. Enters lifespan context manager
   ↓
3. Executes code before yield (STARTUP)
   - Loads articles from database
   - Prints statistics
   ↓
4. Yields control (SERVER RUNS)
   - Handles requests
   - Serves API endpoints
   ↓
5. Server shutdown signal received
   ↓
6. Executes code after yield (SHUTDOWN)
   - Cleanup operations
   - Closes connections
   ↓
7. FastAPI exits gracefully
```

## 📚 Why This Is Better

| Aspect | Old (@on_event) | New (lifespan) |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Deprecation** | ⚠️ Deprecated | ✅ Current standard |
| **Async Support** | Limited | ✅ Full async/await |
| **Code Organization** | Separate functions | ✅ Single context |
| **Type Safety** | Basic | ✅ Better typing |
| **Future Proof** | ❌ Will be removed | ✅ Long-term support |

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Startup Code:
Put anything that needs to run **once** when the server starts:
- Database connections
- Load initial data
- Initialize caches
- Setup background tasks

### For Shutdown Code:
Put cleanup operations:
- Close database connections
- Save state
- Cancel background tasks
- Flush logs

## ✅ Conclusion

The backend server now uses the modern, recommended approach for handling startup and shutdown events:
- ✅ No more deprecation warnings
- ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code
- ✅ Future-proof implementation
- ✅ Better async support

**Status:** Production ready with modern FastAPI patterns! 🚀
