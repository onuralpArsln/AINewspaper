# RSS2DB Image Handling Overhaul

## Overview

The RSS2DB module has been overhauled to provide a unified and comprehensive image handling system. Previously, image URLs were scattered across multiple database columns (`image_url`, `image_urls`, and embedded in `content`), making it difficult to work with images consistently.

## What Changed

### Before
- **Multiple image columns**: `image_url` (single string), `image_urls` (JSON array)
- **Incomplete extraction**: Images only extracted from basic RSS fields
- **Poor user experience**: Had to check multiple columns to get all images
- **Inconsistent data**: Some images in content/description were missed

### After
- **Single unified column**: All images stored in `image_urls` as a JSON array
- **Comprehensive extraction**: Images found from ALL possible sources
- **Better user experience**: One column to rule them all
- **Enhanced parsing**: Advanced regex patterns catch more image types

## Database Schema Changes

### New Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE articles (
    ...
    image_urls TEXT,  -- JSON array of ALL image URLs (consolidated)
    ...
);
```

### Removed Columns
- `image_url` (single string) - deprecated, data migrated to `image_urls`

## Image Extraction Sources

The new system extracts images from **all** of the following sources:

1. **RSS Feed Fields**
   - `media:content` tags
   - `media:thumbnail` tags
   - `enclosures` with image MIME types
   - Direct image URLs from feed

2. **HTML Content**
   - Standard `<img src="">` tags
   - Lazy-loaded images (`data-src`, `data-lazy`, `data-original`)
   - CSS background images (`background-image: url()`)
   - Responsive images (`srcset` attributes)
   - Images in `<figure>` tags

3. **Text Fields**
   - Article `content`
   - Article `description`
   - Article `summary`

4. **Media Attachments**
   - All enclosures marked as images
   - Media content with image MIME types

## Image URL Processing

### Validation
- Validates proper HTTP/HTTPS URLs
- Checks for valid URL structure
- Filters out tracking pixels (1x1, pixel trackers, beacons)

### Cleaning
- Decodes HTML entities (`&amp;` → `&`)
- Removes duplicate URLs
- Normalizes URL format

### Deduplication
- Maintains a set of unique URLs per article
- Case-sensitive comparison (URLs are case-sensitive)

## Usage

### Running RSS2DB with New Image Extraction

```bash
cd backend
python rss2db.py
```

The script will automatically:
1. Extract images from all sources
2. Validate and clean URLs
3. Store consolidated list in `image_urls` column
4. Display image statistics in the summary

### Migrating Existing Database

If you have an existing database with the old schema:

```bash
cd backend
python migrate_images.py
```

This will:
- Extract images from old `image_url` column
- Parse all HTML content for embedded images
- Consolidate everything into `image_urls`
- Preserve all existing data

### Accessing Images in Code

```python
from rss2db import RSSDatabase
import json

db = RSSDatabase('rss_articles.db')
articles = db.get_recent_articles(10)

for article in articles:
    # Parse the JSON array
    image_urls = json.loads(article['image_urls']) if article['image_urls'] else []
    
    print(f"Article: {article['title']}")
    print(f"Images: {len(image_urls)}")
    
    for idx, url in enumerate(image_urls, 1):
        print(f"  {idx}. {url}")
```

### Getting Image Statistics

```python
from rss2db import RSSDatabase

db = RSSDatabase('rss_articles.db')
stats = db.get_image_statistics()

print(f"Total articles: {stats['total_articles']}")
print(f"Articles with images: {stats['articles_with_images']}")
print(f"Total images: {stats['total_images']}")
print(f"Average images per article: {stats['average_images_per_article']}")
```

## API Changes

### New Methods

#### `RSSDatabase.extract_all_image_urls_from_article(article)`
Comprehensive image extraction from all sources in an RSS article.
- **Returns**: `List[str]` - Validated and deduplicated image URLs
- **Usage**: Called automatically during article insertion

#### `RSSDatabase.get_image_statistics()`
Get comprehensive statistics about images in the database.
- **Returns**: Dictionary with image stats
- **Fields**: 
  - `total_articles`
  - `articles_with_images`
  - `articles_without_images`
  - `total_images`
  - `average_images_per_article`
  - `max_images_in_article`

#### `RSSDatabase._extract_images_from_html(html_content)`
Extract all image URLs from HTML content using advanced regex patterns.
- **Returns**: `Set[str]` - Raw image URLs found in HTML

#### `RSSDatabase._clean_image_url(url)`
Clean and validate a single image URL.
- **Returns**: `str` - Cleaned URL or empty string if invalid

#### `RSSDatabase._validate_and_filter_image_urls(urls)`
Validate, clean, and deduplicate a list of image URLs.
- **Returns**: `List[str]` - Validated unique URLs

### Updated Methods

#### `RSSDatabase.insert_article(article)`
Now automatically extracts and consolidates all images before insertion.

#### `RSSToDatabase.print_processing_summary(stats)`
Now includes comprehensive image statistics in the output.

## Image Extraction Patterns

The system uses the following regex patterns to find images:

```python
patterns = [
    r'<img[^>]+src=["\']([^"\']+)["\']',                    # Standard img
    r'<img[^>]+data-src=["\']([^"\']+)["\']',               # Lazy loading
    r'<img[^>]+data-lazy=["\']([^"\']+)["\']',              # Alt lazy
    r'<img[^>]+data-original=["\']([^"\']+)["\']',          # Original
    r'background-image:\s*url\(["\']?([^"\'()]+)["\']?\)',  # CSS backgrounds
    r'<figure[^>]*>.*?<img[^>]+src=["\']([^"\']+)["\']',    # Figure tags
    r'srcset=["\']([^"\']+)["\']',                          # Responsive
]
```

## Benefits

### For Developers
- **Single source of truth**: All images in one column
- **Easier querying**: `SELECT image_urls FROM articles` gets everything
- **Better data consistency**: No scattered or missing images
- **Comprehensive extraction**: Catches more images than before

### For Users
- **More images**: Advanced parsing finds images that were previously missed
- **Better quality**: Filtering removes tracking pixels and invalid URLs
- **Consistent experience**: All articles processed the same way
- **Detailed statistics**: Know exactly how many images you have

## Migration Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Old `image_url` column data is automatically migrated on first run
- Migration is non-destructive (original data preserved until confirmed working)
- Can run migration script multiple times safely (idempotent)

### Performance
- Migration may take a few minutes for large databases
- Processing time increases slightly due to comprehensive extraction
- Database size may increase slightly due to more images found

## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Being Found
- Check that article has HTML content (not just plain text)
- Verify images use standard `<img>` tags or supported patterns
- Check if images are in CSS that doesn't use `background-image`

### Too Many Images Extracted
- Review the filtering logic in `_clean_image_url()`
- Add custom filters for your specific use case
- Some articles legitimately have many images

### Migration Issues
- Ensure you have a backup of your database first
- Check that you have write permissions on the database file
- Review the migration log for specific error messages
