# Logo Placeholder

This directory is ready for your logo.png file.

## Instructions:
1. Upload your logo.png file to this directory
2. The logo should be:
   - PNG format (recommended for transparency)
   - Height: around 60px (will auto-scale)
   - Width: up to 200px max
   - Transparent background (optional)

## Current Setup:
- Logo appears on the left side of the header upper section
- Clickable logo that links to home page
- Responsive design - stacks vertically on mobile
- Graceful fallback if logo file is missing

The system will automatically hide the logo if the file is not found.
